#Employee Shift Scheduling using Ant Colony Optimization

## 1. Case Study Selection
This project addresses an employee shift scheduling problem, which is a
constraint-based optimization task commonly found in workforce management.
The objective is to minimize staffing shortages while maintaining fair
workload distribution.

## 2. Algorithm Exploration
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is employed due to its effectiveness in solving
combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm constructs candidate
schedules probabilistically based on pheromone intensity and fitness feedback.

## 3. Performance Analysis
The algorithm exhibits consistent convergence behavior across multiple runs.
Fitness values improve as iterations progress, indicating effective exploration
and exploitation of the solution space.

## 4. Extended Analysis: Multi-Objective Optimization
In addition to meeting staffing demand, workload balance is considered as a
secondary objective. The inclusion of this objective improves fairness but
introduces trade-offs in convergence speed and solution diversity.
